You wake up one day in a room you do not recognize. You then see a yellow dog sleeping in the drawer of a cabinet and you don't recognize this dog. You also notice that you are in a pajama. 

You can pat the sleeping dog. Or you can find yourself out of the said room. Or you can check your bed for clues.

What shall you do?
1. Walk to the dog and pat him.
2. Find yourself out of the room.
3. Check your bed for clues about yourself.
